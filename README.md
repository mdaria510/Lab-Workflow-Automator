# Lab-Workflow-Automator
Automate workflow, significantly increasing productivity and reducing medical errors.

**Not for public usage, only present for portfolio purposes.**

Written in AutoHotKey (A UI scripting language with C-style syntax) for flexible UI automation. Almost 2000 lines of code written, tested and debugged without the assistance of an IDE (because I was unable to install arbitrary software on company PC.)

Deceptively complex, but in practice it means I have to enter only the absolute minimum amount of keystrokes at decision points, saving up to a minute per case - at an average of 70 cases a day, this is a major productivity boost. It also contains many functions to prevent errors.

This program was built up bit by bit over the course of a few months - eventually I ran into a functionality wall with AutoHotKey and if I were to refactor it, I would use a more powerful language. But as it was, it covers 95% of use cases in day to day work and has been a rock solid assistant at my day job for almost 3 years now.
